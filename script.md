Steps to Calculate:
Find total worked hours for each In/Out pair

09:30 AM → 11:15 AM → 1 hr 45 min
11:38 AM → 01:30 PM → 1 hr 52 min
01:52 PM → 03:00 PM → 1 hr 08 min

Add up total worked time

1:45 + 1:52 + 1:08
Convert to minutes for easy addition:
105 min + 112 min + 68 min = 285 min
Convert back to hours: 4 hr 45 min
Find remaining time needed

7:30 - 4:45 = 2:45 (2 hours 45 minutes left to work)
Add remaining time to last In-time (03:19 PM)

03:19 PM + 2 hr 45 min = 06:04 PM
